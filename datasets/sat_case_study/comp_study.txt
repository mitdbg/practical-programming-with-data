Table 3 compares the throughput among the four pairs at 11,000 km. Table 4 compares the throughput for the same four pairs, but at a distance of 5,500 km. We can see that the general observations still hold: (1) loss-based schemes such as NewReno and Cubic achieve high throughput but suffers from large latency, (2) delay-based schemes such as Vegas achieves shortest delay but suffers from low throughput or variation in throughput, and (3) BRR makes a good tradeoff with good throughput and good delay
